# python-rss-parser
The simplest and most basic rss parser for python.

## What does it do? ##
The workflow is pretty straightforward:
 - Load an RSS url
 - Parse it with regular expressions
 - Extract the Link, Title and date from each item
 - Return an array containing the information

## Improvements ##
There are so many things that could be improved that you might just write something new from scratch if you want something that implements the RSS standard decently.
